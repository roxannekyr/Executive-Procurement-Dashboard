🛠️ Supply Chain & Procurement Analytics

An end-to-end BI project demonstrating advanced data modeling and visualization techniques to solve supply chain challenges.<br />

Technical Highlights:

Star Schema Modeling: Designed a robust data model connecting Fact tables (Purchase Orders, Invoices) with Dimension tables (Vendors, Items, Time, Location).

Advanced DAX: Created dynamic measures for Year-over-Year Spend Growth, Weighted Average Lead Time, and Pareto Analysis (80/20 rule).

Drill-through Functionality: Enabled users to drill from high-level category spend down to specific invoice-level details.

Dynamic Visuals: Used field parameters to allow users to switch views between "Spend Amount" and "Order Quantity" on the fly.
